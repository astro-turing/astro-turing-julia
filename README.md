# Diagenetic modelling in Julia
This repository contains example codes to solve numerical PDEs in Julia. The goal is to reproduce the results from Ivan l'Heureux 2018.

To learn more, please visit our [Github Pages](https://astro-turing.github.io/astro-turing-julia).

## Literate programming
There are several notes in here that work with the concept of literate programming. The Julia scripts are contained in the notes as code blocks, and assembled by a process called *tangling* to generate executable scripts.

To edit these scripts and/or notes, you should have [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io) installed and running.

## Julia
We use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to do our computations. Julia is a modern and friendly programming language that is focussed on doing numerical work. It may be considered a blend of Python and Matlab with performance closer to Fortran or C.
